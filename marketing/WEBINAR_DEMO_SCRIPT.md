# Webinar & Demo Scripts

## Script 1: Sales Demo (15 minutes)

---

### Opening (2 minutes)

**Presenter:**

"Thanks for taking 15 minutes with me today, {{prospect_name}}.

Before I show you anything, I want to understand your practice better.

Quick questions:
1. How many returns do you prepare annually?
2. What percentage of your clients receive advisory services beyond basic prep?
3. When a client asks 'what if I elected S-Corp,' how do you typically handle that?

[LISTEN TO ANSWERS]

Got it. So like most CPAs, you're probably saying 'let me get back to you' more than you'd like. And the advisory revenue... there's room to grow.

Here's what I want to show you in the next 12 minutes:

1. How to answer 'what if' questions in real-time (2 min)
2. How to generate advisory reports in under a minute (2 min)
3. How to identify your best leads automatically (2 min)
4. How this would work for your specific practice (5 min)

Sound good? Let's dive in."

---

### Demo Section 1: Delta Analysis (3 minutes)

**Presenter:**

"Let me show you the feature that changes everything for most CPAs.

[SHARE SCREEN - Show a sample tax return]

Here's a freelancer earning $150,000. They've asked: 'What if I max out my SEP-IRA?'

Old way: You'd say 'let me run the numbers' and spend a few hours in spreadsheets.

Watch what happens when I do it here.

[CHANGE THE SEP-IRA CONTRIBUTION TO $30,000]

Instantly, you see:
- AGI dropped by $30,000
- Taxable income dropped by $30,000
- Tax liability dropped by $7,200
- Effective rate went from 22% to 18%

[POINT TO THE DELTA PANEL]

This is delta analysis. One change, instant impact.

Now imagine you're sitting with that client. Instead of 'let me get back to you,' you say: 'You'll save $7,200. Here's exactly how.'

They don't need to think about it. They see the value. They sign.

Any questions on this before I show you the next feature?"

---

### Demo Section 2: Advisory Reports (3 minutes)

**Presenter:**

"Now, showing them the impact is great. But to justify a $1,500 advisory fee, you need a deliverable.

Watch this.

[CLICK 'GENERATE ADVISORY REPORT']

45 seconds... and here's a 20-page professional report.

[SCROLL THROUGH REPORT]

- Executive summary with key findings
- Tax position breakdown
- Optimization opportunities with dollar amounts
- Entity structure comparison
- Retirement contribution analysis
- Action items with priorities

Every recommendation includes IRS code citations. This isn't generic advice—it's defensible, professional work.

[HIGHLIGHT SAVINGS SECTION]

See this? 'Total identified savings: $12,450.'

When a client sees this number in a professional report, $1,500 for your advisory feels like a bargain.

What used to take you 4-6 hours now takes 45 seconds."

---

### Demo Section 3: Lead Scoring (2 minutes)

**Presenter:**

"Now let's talk about finding the right clients.

[NAVIGATE TO LEAD DASHBOARD]

Not all leads are equal. A business owner exploring S-Corp election is not the same as a W-2 filer wanting TurboTax prices.

Our lead engine tracks 27 behavioral signals and categorizes leads into 5 states:

[POINT TO LEAD STATES]

- BROWSING and CURIOUS - We hide these. They're noise.
- EVALUATING - You can see them, but don't chase them yet.
- ADVISORY-READY - These are ready to buy. Engage now.
- HIGH-LEVERAGE - Business owners, high income, complex situations. Priority.

[CLICK ON A HIGH-LEVERAGE LEAD]

See these signals? Business income over $100K, investment portfolio, multi-state. This is a $1,500+ client.

Instead of treating all leads equally and wasting 60% of your time on tire-kickers, you focus on the ones that convert."

---

### Personalization Section (3 minutes)

**Presenter:**

"Now let me show you how this would work for your specific practice.

You mentioned you handle about {{prospect_return_count}} returns per year, with {{prospect_advisory_pct}}% getting advisory services.

Let's do some quick math.

[PULL UP CALCULATOR OR WHITEBOARD]

If you have 200 clients and 30% (60 clients) get advisory services at an average of $800... that's $48,000 in advisory revenue.

With this platform, CPAs typically see:
- Advisory percentage goes from 30% to 50% (you can answer questions on the spot)
- Average advisory value goes from $800 to $1,200 (professional reports justify higher fees)

That's 100 clients at $1,200 = $120,000 in advisory revenue.

$72,000 more per year. That's the impact.

And I haven't even mentioned the time savings. If you're saving 4 hours per advisory engagement, that's 400 hours per year you get back.

What would you do with 400 extra hours?"

---

### Closing (2 minutes)

**Presenter:**

"So here's what we covered:

1. Delta analysis lets you answer 'what if' questions in seconds
2. Advisory reports in 45 seconds justify $1,500+ fees
3. Lead scoring surfaces your most valuable prospects

The platform is $199/month for Starter or $499/month for Professional with white-label branding.

To put that in perspective: Close ONE advisory deal per month and it pays for itself 3x over.

Here's what I recommend as a next step:

Start a 14-day free trial. Pick 3 clients you know have complex situations. Run their scenarios through the platform. See the difference.

If it doesn't help you close more advisory deals, cancel before the trial ends. No charge.

What questions do you have?"

## Script 2: Webinar (45 minutes)

### Title: "How to Double Your Advisory Revenue Without Working More Hours"

---

### Part 1: Opening & Hook (5 minutes)

**Slide 1: Title Slide**

"Welcome everyone. I'm {{presenter_name}}, and for the next 45 minutes, I'm going to show you how CPAs are doubling their advisory revenue without working more hours.

But first, a question for the chat:

When a client asks 'What if I elected S-Corp?' or 'Should I max out my retirement?' — how long does it take you to give them a real answer?

[PAUSE FOR CHAT RESPONSES]

Days? A week? Most CPAs tell me the same thing.

And here's what happens in those days: The client talks to another CPA. Or they figure it out themselves. Or they just... forget.

Today I'm going to show you a different approach."

---

**Slide 2: The Advisory Gap**

"Here's a stat that should bother you:

**70% of CPA clients receive ZERO advisory services.**

Think about that. 7 out of 10 clients who trust you with their taxes never get advice on how to actually save money.

Is it because CPAs don't know the strategies? No.
Is it because clients don't want help? No.

It's because there's no time.

Running an S-Corp analysis takes 3-4 hours.
Generating a comprehensive tax planning report takes 4-6 hours.
Following up on every 'let me think about it' takes more hours.

So we default to: 'Let me get back to you.'

And the opportunity dies."

---

### Part 2: The Problem Deep Dive (10 minutes)

**Slide 3: The $1,500 Problem**

"Let me put numbers to this.

Average tax prep fee: $300
Average advisory fee: $1,500

Every client who doesn't get advisory is $1,500 left on the table.

100 clients × $1,500 = $150,000 in missed revenue.

And that's conservative. Complex clients—business owners, investors, high earners—those advisory engagements can be $2,500-5,000 each.

The revenue is there. The expertise is there. The time isn't."

---

**Slide 4: The Lead Problem**

"But it's not just about existing clients. It's about finding the right new clients.

How much time do you spend on leads that never convert?

If you're like most CPAs, it's 60% or more of your prospecting time.

Website visitors who never respond.
Price shoppers who want TurboTax at CPA prices.
Simple W-2 filers who don't need (or want to pay for) expertise.

Meanwhile, somewhere in that pile of leads is a business owner with $500K revenue who's ready to pay $2,000 for entity structure advice.

But you're treating all leads equally. So you miss them."

---

**Slide 5: The Real Cost**

"Let's add it up:

- Advisory revenue left on the table: $150,000+
- Time wasted on wrong leads: 500+ hours/year
- Clients lost to 'let me get back to you': Unknown but significant

This is the real cost of not having the right tools.

Now let me show you what the right tools look like."

---

### Part 3: The Solution Demo (15 minutes)

**Slide 6: Introducing the Platform**

"There are three capabilities that change everything:

1. Real-time delta analysis
2. Instant advisory reports
3. Intelligent lead scoring

Let me show you each one."

---

**[LIVE DEMO - Delta Analysis] (5 minutes)**

"I'm going to switch to a live demo.

[SHARE SCREEN]

Here's a freelancer earning $150,000. They've asked about S-Corp election.

Watch what happens when I model the S-Corp scenario.

[MAKE THE CHANGE]

Instantly:
- Current SE tax: $21,195
- S-Corp SE tax (at $80K salary): $12,240
- Annual savings: $8,955

I didn't go to a spreadsheet. I didn't say 'let me get back to you.' I showed them the answer in 60 seconds.

[CHANGE ANOTHER VARIABLE]

What if we also max out a SEP-IRA? Watch the tax liability.

[SHOW THE IMPACT]

Another $7,200 in savings.

This is delta analysis. Change any number, see instant impact. Close deals on the spot."

---

**[LIVE DEMO - Advisory Reports] (5 minutes)**

"Now, showing them the number is great. But to justify a $1,500 advisory fee, you need a professional deliverable.

[CLICK GENERATE REPORT]

45 seconds.

[SCROLL THROUGH REPORT]

Look at this:
- Executive summary with total savings identified
- Entity structure comparison
- Retirement optimization analysis
- Action items with priorities
- IRS code citations throughout

This is not a template with blanks filled in. This is a comprehensive analysis that took 45 seconds instead of 4 hours.

When you hand this to a client, $1,500 feels like a bargain."

---

**[LIVE DEMO - Lead Scoring] (5 minutes)**

"Finally, let's talk about finding the right clients.

[NAVIGATE TO LEAD DASHBOARD]

See these lead states?

BROWSING and CURIOUS - Hidden. These are noise.
EVALUATING - Visible but not priority.
ADVISORY-READY - Ready to buy. Engage now.
HIGH-LEVERAGE - Business owners, high income, complex. Top priority.

[CLICK ON A HIGH-LEVERAGE LEAD]

Look at the signals: Business income $300K+, investment portfolio, multi-state filing.

This is a $2,500 client. And the system surfaced them automatically.

Instead of treating all leads equally, you focus on the ones that convert."

---

### Part 4: Case Studies (10 minutes)

**Slide 7: Sarah's Story**

"Let me share what happened for Sarah, a CPA in Denver.

Before the platform:
- 30% of clients got advisory services
- Average advisory fee: $600
- Said 'let me get back to you' multiple times per week

After 6 months:
- 55% of clients get advisory services
- Average advisory fee: $1,100
- Answers questions in real-time

Advisory revenue increase: 40%

Here's what she told us:

'The first time I showed a client their S-Corp savings on the spot, they looked at me like I was magic. They signed a $1,200 engagement that day. That never happened before.'"

---

**Slide 8: Michael's Story**

"Michael runs a firm in Atlanta focused on small business clients.

His problem wasn't advisory—it was leads.

He was spending 60% of his time on prospects who never converted. Price shoppers. Simple filers. People who wanted TurboTax prices with CPA expertise.

We turned on lead scoring.

Within 30 days:
- Time on unqualified leads: Down 70%
- Close rate: Up 40%
- Average engagement value: Up 35%

His comment: 'The lead scoring alone pays for the platform. I stopped chasing cold leads and focused on high-value prospects.'"

---

**Slide 9: Jennifer's Story**

"Jennifer is a solo practitioner in Phoenix.

She was skeptical. 'I don't have time to learn new software.'

We pointed out: The platform saves 4 hours per complex engagement. Learning curve: 1 hour.

After 90 days:
- 12 additional advisory engagements closed
- Average value: $1,100 each
- Total additional revenue: $13,200

Her time investment: Maybe 10 hours total including learning.

ROI: 1,320%.

Her quote: 'I closed a $2,500 deal in 10 minutes because I could show the S-Corp savings on the spot. That conversation used to take a week.'"

---

### Part 5: Objection Handling (5 minutes)

**Slide 10: Common Questions**

"Before we wrap up, let me address the questions I know you're thinking:

**'I already have tax software.'**

Good. Keep it. We're not replacing your tax software—we're adding an intelligence layer. We handle the 'what if' analysis; your software handles the filing.

**'Is it really accurate?'**

We run 1,557 automated tests covering edge cases most CPAs never see. 40+ IRS forms. All 50 states. If there's an error, we find it before you do.

**'Is $199/month worth it?'**

Close ONE $500 advisory engagement per month. That's 2.5x ROI. Most CPAs close 3-5 additional engagements per month.

**'I don't have time to learn new software.'**

Learning curve: 1 hour. Time saved per engagement: 4+ hours. You'll be positive within your first complex client.

**'My clients won't pay for advisory.'**

They're already paying other CPAs for advisory. Or making decisions without tax insight. The question is whether they'll pay YOU for advisory. When you can show them savings in real-time, they will."
