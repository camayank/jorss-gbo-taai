### Sponsored Content - Long Form

**Ad 1: The Advisory Gap**

**Headline:** CPAs: Are You Leaving $1,500 Per Client on the Table?

**Body:**
70% of CPA clients receive zero advisory services.

Not because you don't know the strategies. Because there's no time to do the analysis.

What if you could answer "what if I elected S-Corp?" in 60 seconds—with real numbers, not estimates?

That's what we built.

Real-time tax impact visualization.
Advisory reports in 45 seconds.
Lead scoring that surfaces high-value prospects.

CPAs using our platform are closing 40% more advisory deals.

**CTA:** See It In Action →

**Ad 2: The S-Corp Conversation**

**Headline:** A 60-Second Conversation Worth $1,200

**Body:**
Client: "Should I be an S-Corp?"

Old answer: "Let me run the numbers and call you next week."
New answer: [Shows screen] "You'll save $8,955/year. Here's the breakdown."

Same question. Same expertise. Different outcome.

One loses the deal to "I'll think about it."
One closes a $1,200 advisory engagement on the spot.

The difference? Having the tools to show impact in real-time.

**CTA:** Watch the Demo →

**Ad 3: Lead Quality**

**Headline:** Stop Chasing Tire-Kickers. Start Closing High-Value Clients.

**Body:**
Not all tax leads are equal.

A business owner exploring S-Corp election → $1,500 advisory client
A W-2 filer wanting the cheapest prep → $200 loss leader

Our lead scoring engine automatically identifies:
- High income ($200K+)
- Business owners
- Investors with capital gains
- Multi-state filers
- Clients ready for advisory

These are your profitable clients. We surface them.

### Sponsored InMail

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company] and advisory services

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed you run a CPA practice focused on business clients—exactly the market where advisory services matter most.

Quick question: When a client asks "What if I elected S-Corp?" or "Should I max out my SEP-IRA?"—how long does it take to answer?

For most CPAs, it's days. Sometimes a week.

We built a platform that answers in seconds—with real numbers, not estimates. CPAs using it are closing 40% more advisory deals.

Would a 15-minute demo be worth your time?

Here's my calendar: [LINK]

Or just reply to this message and we'll find a time.

Best,
{{sender_name}}

P.S. — Here's a 2-minute video showing how it works: [LINK]
