### Post 1: The Advisory Gap

**Post:**

70% of CPA clients receive ZERO advisory services.

Not because CPAs don't know the strategies.
Not because clients don't want help.

Because there's no time.

Running a "what if I elected S-Corp" analysis takes 3-4 hours manually.
Generating a comprehensive tax planning report takes 4-6 hours.
Following up on every "let me think about it" takes hours more.

So we default to: "Let me get back to you."

And clients leave. Opportunities die.

What if you could answer those questions in seconds?

That's what we built.

Real-time tax impact visualization.
Advisory reports in 45 seconds.
Scenario comparison at the click of a button.

The CPAs using this aren't working harder.
They're just equipped to have the conversation.

And they're closing advisory deals their competitors can't.

### Post 2: The S-Corp Conversation

**Post:**

A freelancer earning $150K asked me: "Should I be an S-Corp?"

Old me: "Let me run the numbers and get back to you next week."

New me: Pulled up the analysis in 60 seconds and showed them:

Current SE tax as sole prop: $21,195
SE tax as S-Corp (at $80K salary): $12,240
Annual savings: $8,955
IRS risk level: LOW

They didn't need to think about it.
They signed a $1,200 advisory engagement on the spot.

That conversation used to take me 4 hours of manual work.
Now it takes 60 seconds.

Same expertise. Same client. Same outcome.

Just faster.

Technology isn't replacing CPAs.
It's helping us actually use our expertise.

### Post 3: The Real Reason Clients Leave

**Post:**

Clients don't leave CPAs because of price.

They leave because of THIS phrase:

"Let me get back to you."

Every time you say it, you're telling them:
- Your question isn't important enough for an immediate answer
- You'll have to wait days for clarity
- I'm too busy to help you right now

Meanwhile, someone else IS answering questions in real-time.

The firms growing fastest in 2025 aren't the cheapest.
They're the most responsive.

When a client asks "What if I max out my 401(k)?" the winning answer is:

"You'll save $7,200. Here's exactly how. Want to talk about implementation?"

Not: "Let me run the numbers and call you next week."

Same expertise. Different delivery.

One closes deals. One loses them.

### Post 4: Lead Scoring Reality

**Post:**

I used to treat all leads the same.

Website visitor? Follow up.
Email inquiry? Follow up.
Referral? Follow up.

60% of my prospecting time was wasted on leads that never converted.

Then I learned something:

A business owner exploring S-Corp election is NOT the same as a W-2 employee looking for the cheapest tax prep.

One is a $1,500+ advisory client.
One is a $200 price-shopper who'll leave for TurboTax next year.

Now I score leads before I engage:
- Business income? High priority.
- Investment portfolio? High priority.
- Multi-state income? High priority.
- Simple W-2, standard deduction? Low priority.

I stopped chasing everyone.
I started closing the right people.

My close rate went up 40%.
My average engagement value went up 60%.
My stress went down significantly.

Not every lead deserves your time.
Focus on the ones who do.

### Post 5: The ROI Question

**Post:**

"Is it worth $199/month?"

Let me do the math:

Platform cost: $199/month

To break even: Close ONE advisory engagement worth $199+

Average advisory engagement: $800-2,500

ROI on one deal per month: 4-12x

ROI on two deals per month: 8-25x

But that's not even the full picture.

What's the value of:
- 12-19 hours saved per complex client?
- Leads you would have missed?
- Clients who stay because you answered faster?
- Referrals from impressed clients?

The question isn't "Can I afford this?"

It's "Can I afford to keep saying 'let me get back to you'?"

Unpopular CPA opinion:

Not every lead deserves your time.

A business owner with complex needs? Priority.
A W-2 filer who wants TurboTax prices? Not your client.

Focus is the new hustle.

### Short Post 4:
Client: "What if I max out my 401(k)?"

Bad answer: "Let me run the numbers and call you."

Good answer: "You'll save $7,200. Here's the breakdown."

The difference? $1,500 in advisory fees.

### Short Post 5:
The math on advisory services:

Average prep fee: $300
Average advisory fee: $1,500

Clients who get advisory: 30%

Revenue left on the table: $1,050 per client.

x 100 clients = $105,000/year.

### Tweet 1:
70% of CPA clients get zero advisory services.

Not because CPAs don't know the strategies.

Because there's no time to do the analysis.

Fix the time problem, unlock the revenue.

Old answer: "Let me get back to you next week."
New answer: "You'll save $8,955/year. Here's the breakdown."

### Tweet 3:
The best CPA marketing isn't better ads.

It's faster answers.

When you can show tax impact in real-time, clients don't shop around.

### Tweet 4:
Advisory revenue formula:

1. Ask better questions
2. Show immediate impact
3. Quantify savings
4. Present professional report
5. Close on the spot

Step 2 is where most CPAs fail.

---

### Tweet 5:
Stop competing on price with TurboTax.

Start competing on value with advisory.

$300 prep fees are a race to the bottom.
$1,500 advisory fees are a path to growth.
