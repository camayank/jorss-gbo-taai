### Email 2: Day 2 — The AHA Moment

**Subject:** The moment everything clicks (for most CPAs)

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Most CPAs tell us there's one feature that changes everything: **Delta Analysis.**

Here's the scenario:

A client asks: "What if I max out my 401(k)?"

**Old way:** "Let me run the numbers and get back to you next week."
**New way:** "You'll save $7,200. Here's exactly how." (Shows them on screen)

The client doesn't shop around. They sign.

That "aha moment" is waiting for you.

### Email 3: Day 4 — The Lead Problem

**Subject:** Are you chasing the wrong leads?

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: How much time do you spend on leads that never convert?

If you're like most CPAs, it's 60% or more of your prospecting time.

Here's what we discovered:

**Not all leads are equal.**

A business owner with $300K revenue who's exploring S-Corp election is NOT the same as a W-2 employee looking for the cheapest tax prep.

Our Lead State Engine automatically identifies:
- High-income earners ($200K+)
- Business owners with complex needs
- Investors with capital gains
- Multi-state filers
- Clients ready for advisory services

These are your $1,500+ clients. We surface them so you stop wasting time on tire-kickers.

### Email 4: Day 7 — Social Proof

**Subject:** "My advisory revenue is up 40%"

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to share what Sarah M., a CPA in Denver, told us:

> "Before [Platform], scenario analysis took hours. Now I show clients tax impact in seconds. My advisory revenue is up 40%."

Here's what changed for her:

1. **Stopped saying "let me get back to you"** — answers questions in real-time
2. **Closed advisory deals on the spot** — clients see the value immediately
3. **Focused on high-value clients** — lead scoring filtered out the noise

Sarah closed a $2,800 advisory engagement last month because she could show S-Corp savings on the spot.

What would an extra $2,800/month mean for your practice?

### Email 5: Day 10 — Pricing Objection

**Subject:** "Is this worth $199/month?"

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Fair question. Let me do the math:

**Platform cost:** $199/month

**To break even:** Close ONE advisory engagement worth $199+

**Reality:** Most CPAs close advisory deals worth $800-2,500 each

Here's the simple ROI:
- 1 advisory deal/month = 4-12x ROI
- 2 advisory deals/month = 8-25x ROI
- 3 advisory deals/month = 12-37x ROI

And that's not counting:
- Time saved (12-19 hours per complex client)
- Leads you would have missed
- Clients you retain because of better service

The question isn't "Can I afford this?"

The question is "Can I afford NOT to have instant tax intelligence?"

### Email 7: Day 14 — Final Call

**Subject:** Last chance: Your trial expires today

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

This is it — your trial expires at midnight.

After today, you'll go back to:
- "Let me get back to you" instead of instant answers
- Manual scenario analysis instead of one-click calculations
- Guessing which leads are worth your time

Or you can upgrade and keep access to everything.

## Sequence 2: Cold Outreach (To CPA Firms)

---

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Quick question about {{company_name}}'s advisory services

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company_name}} serves business owners and high-income clients — the exact market where advisory services matter most.

Quick question: When a client asks "What if I elect S-Corp?" or "Should I max out my SEP-IRA?" — how long does it take to give them an answer?

For most CPAs, it's days. Sometimes a week.

We built a platform that answers those questions in seconds — with real numbers, not estimates.

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo to see if it fits your practice?

{{sender_name}}

P.S. — Here's a 2-minute video showing how it works: [LINK]

### Email 2: Follow-up (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about {{company_name}}'s advisory services

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my note from Tuesday.

I'll keep this short: CPAs using our platform close 40% more advisory deals because they can show clients tax impact in real-time.

No more "let me get back to you." Just instant answers that build trust.

Worth a 15-minute look?

### Email 3: Value-Add (Day 7)

**Subject:** The $1,500 conversation most CPAs aren't having

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Did you know 70% of CPA clients receive zero advisory services?

That's $1,500+ per client left on the table — not because CPAs don't know the strategies, but because they don't have time to run the analysis.

We fix that.

Here's a real example:

**Client situation:** Freelancer earning $150K
**Question:** "Should I be an S-Corp?"
**Old way:** 3-4 hours of manual analysis, $0 advisory fee
**Our way:** 60-second comparison showing $8,955 annual savings, $1,200 advisory fee

Same client. Same CPA expertise. 60 seconds instead of 4 hours. $1,200 instead of $0.

Interested in seeing how this would work for your clients?

### Email 4: Breakup Email (Day 14)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about helping {{company_name}} grow advisory revenue with real-time tax intelligence.

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

No problem — I'll close out this thread.

If anything changes, here's my calendar link: [LINK]

And if you just want to see a quick demo video (no call required), it's here: [LINK]

Best of luck with tax season.

## Sequence 3: Nurture (Monthly Newsletter)

---

### Newsletter 1: Tax Planning Insights

**Subject:** 3 advisory conversations your clients want (but aren't having)

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Tax season is coming. Here are 3 conversations that turn prep clients into advisory clients:

**1. The S-Corp Question**
"You're paying $15,000/year in unnecessary SE tax. Here's the math."
→ Advisory fee: $800-1,500

**2. The QBI Conversation**
"You're missing a 20% deduction worth $12,000. Let me show you."
→ Advisory fee: $500-1,000

**3. The Retirement Timing Talk**
"If you contribute $20K more to your SEP-IRA, you'll save $7,200 in taxes."
→ Advisory fee: $300-800

The problem? These conversations take hours of analysis — unless you have the right tools.

### Newsletter 2: Feature Spotlight

**Subject:** How one CPA closed a $2,500 deal in 10 minutes

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Last week, Jennifer L. (a CPA in Phoenix) told us this story:

A business owner came in asking if he should switch from sole prop to S-Corp.

Old Jennifer would have said: "Let me run some numbers and get back to you."

New Jennifer pulled up our Entity Optimizer and showed him:
- Current SE tax: $21,195/year
- S-Corp SE tax (at $80K salary): $12,240/year
- Annual savings: $8,955
- IRS risk level: LOW

The client saw the numbers. Jennifer explained the reasonable salary analysis. 10 minutes later, he signed a $2,500 advisory engagement.

"That never happened before," Jennifer said. "Clients would leave to 'think about it' and half would never come back."

Now they don't leave. They sign.

### Newsletter 3: Tax Season Prep

**Subject:** 5 ways to make this tax season your most profitable

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Tax season is {{days_until_season}} days away. Here's how to make it your most profitable yet:

**1. Identify your high-value clients NOW**
Review last year's returns. Who had business income, investments, or complex situations? Those are your advisory candidates.

**2. Have the advisory conversation BEFORE prep**
"Before we file, let's make sure you're not leaving money on the table."

**3. Use scenario analysis to show value**
"What if you maxed out your retirement? Here's what that saves you."

**4. Generate a professional advisory report**
A 20-page report justifies $1,500+ fees. A verbal conversation doesn't.

**5. Follow up after filing**
"Now that we've filed, let's talk about next year's tax strategy."
