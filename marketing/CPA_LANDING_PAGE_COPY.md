### Problem Section

## The $28 Billion Problem No One Talks About

**Column 1:**
### 4-6 Hours Per Return
Manual calculations eat your most valuable resource: time. You're stuck in spreadsheets instead of serving clients.

**Column 2:**
### "Let Me Get Back to You"
When clients ask "what if" questions, you can't answer on the spot. They leave. The opportunity dies.

**Column 3:**
### Racing to the Bottom
Competing with TurboTax on $300 prep fees is a losing game. Your expertise is worth more.

**Callout Box:**
> "70% of CPA clients receive zero advisory services. That's $1,500+ per client left on the table."

### Solution Section

**Before/After Visual:**

| CLIENT ASKS | OLD WAY | NEW WAY |
|-------------|---------|---------|

**Feature Highlight:**
When you show a client their exact tax savings in real-time, they don't shop around. They sign.

### FAQ Section

**Q: How accurate are the calculations?**
A: We run 1,557 automated tests covering edge cases most CPAs never see. Our calculation engine covers 40+ IRS forms and all 50 states. If there's an error, we'll find it before you do.

**Q: Can clients see my branded version?**
A: Yes. With Professional and Enterprise plans, clients see only your brand—your logo, colors, and domain. We're completely white-labeled.

**Q: What about data security?**

**Q: How long does setup take?**
A: Most CPAs are running their first scenario within 15 minutes. Full white-label branding takes about an hour.

### Problem Section

## 60% of Your Time Is Wasted on the Wrong Leads

- Random website visitors who never convert

- Simple W-2 filers who want TurboTax prices
- Leads that go cold before you can follow up

**The Real Problem:**
You're treating all leads equally. But a business owner with $500K revenue is not the same as a W-2 employee wanting a quick refund.
