## Example Case Study 1: Sarah M.

# How Sarah M. Increased Advisory Revenue by 40% in 6 Months

## Company Profile

| | |
|---|---|
| **CPA/Firm** | Sarah M., CPA |
| **Location** | Denver, CO |
| **Practice Type** | Solo practitioner, small business focus |
| **Annual Returns** | 150 |
| **Team Size** | 1 (solo) |

---

## The Challenge

Sarah faced a common problem: she knew her clients needed advisory services, but she didn't have time to do the analysis.

### Specific Pain Points:

- **Time constraints**: Every complex "what if" question took 3-4 hours of manual analysis
- **Lost opportunities**: By the time she called clients back, many had "figured it out themselves" or talked to other CPAs
- **Underpriced services**: Without professional deliverables, she struggled to justify advisory fees above $600

### The Impact:

> "I knew my clients were leaving money on the table. I knew the strategies. But I couldn't get the analysis done fast enough. Every time I said 'let me get back to you,' I felt the opportunity slipping away."
> — Sarah M., CPA

Before implementing the platform:
- Advisory clients: 30%
- Average advisory fee: $600
- Time per complex analysis: 4 hours
- Lead conversion rate: 22%

---

## The Solution

Sarah implemented [Platform] to address these challenges.

### Key Features Used:

**1. Delta Analysis**
Real-time tax impact visualization. When clients ask "what if," Sarah shows them the answer immediately—no more "let me get back to you."

**2. Advisory Reports**
Professional 20-page reports generated in 45 seconds. These deliverables justify premium fees and give clients something tangible.

**3. Entity Structure Optimizer**
S-Corp vs. LLC vs. Sole Prop comparison with reasonable salary analysis. Sarah's small business clients get clear recommendations with IRS-defensible numbers.

### Implementation Timeline:

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | 1-hour training, ran first 3 client scenarios |
| 2 | Generated first advisory report, closed $1,100 engagement |
| 3-4 | Integrated into client meetings |
| 5+ | Full adoption across all complex clients |

---

## The Results

After 6 months with the platform:

### By the Numbers:

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Advisory clients | 30% | 55% | +83% |
| Average advisory fee | $600 | $1,100 | +83% |
| Time per analysis | 4 hours | 5 minutes | -98% |
| Lead conversion | 22% | 35% | +59% |

### Revenue Impact:

**Before:** 45 advisory clients × $600 = $27,000/year
**After:** 82 advisory clients × $1,100 = $90,200/year

**Total additional advisory revenue: $63,200/year**

### ROI Calculation:

- Platform cost: $2,388/year (Professional plan)
- Additional revenue: $63,200/year
- **ROI: 2,547%**

---

## Key Moments

### The Turning Point:

> "The first time I showed a client their S-Corp savings on the spot, they looked at me like I was magic. I pulled up the comparison—sole prop SE tax versus S-Corp—and showed them $8,955 in annual savings. They signed a $1,200 engagement that day. That never happened before."
> — Sarah M.

### A Typical Client Conversation:

**Before:**
Client: "Should I be an S-Corp?"
Sarah: "That's a great question. Let me run some numbers and call you next week."

**After:**
Client: "Should I be an S-Corp?"
Sarah: "Let's look at this together. [Shows screen] With your $150K in income, an S-Corp at $80K salary saves you $8,955 per year. Here's exactly how that breaks down."

---

## Advice for Other CPAs

When asked what advice she'd give to other CPAs considering the platform, Sarah said:

> "Just try it with 3 clients. Pick your most complex ones—the business owners, the investors. Run their scenarios. Generate a report. You'll see the difference immediately. I was skeptical too, but the first advisory deal I closed paid for a year of the platform."

### Top 3 Tips:

1. **Start with complex clients**: They're the ones with the most to gain—and the most likely to pay for advisory.
2. **Show, don't tell**: Use the delta analysis in client meetings. Let them see the impact themselves.
3. **Generate the report**: A professional deliverable makes the advisory fee a no-brainer.

---

## Summary

Sarah transformed her solo practice from compliance-focused to advisory-driven without working more hours. By using real-time tax intelligence to answer questions on the spot and generate professional deliverables in seconds, she increased her advisory revenue by 40%—adding over $63,000 in annual revenue while actually reducing the time spent per engagement.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Real-time delta analysis eliminates "let me get back to you"
- Professional reports justify premium advisory fees
- Complex clients are the highest-ROI targets for advisory services

## Example Case Study 2: Michael R.

# How Michael R. Increased Lead Conversion by 40% with Intelligent Scoring

## Company Profile

| | |
|---|---|
| **CPA/Firm** | Michael R. & Associates |
| **Location** | Atlanta, GA |
| **Practice Type** | Small firm, business & individual clients |
| **Annual Returns** | 400 |
| **Team Size** | 4 (2 CPAs, 2 staff) |

---

## The Challenge

Michael's firm was growing—but not efficiently. They were spending 60% of their prospecting time on leads that never converted.

### Specific Pain Points:

- **Lead overload**: Website generated 50+ inquiries per month, but most were price shoppers
- **No prioritization**: All leads got the same follow-up, regardless of potential value
- **Wasted time**: Staff spent hours following up with leads who wanted TurboTax prices

### The Impact:

> "We were drowning in leads but starving for clients. Every inquiry got the same treatment—a phone call, an email, sometimes multiple follow-ups. But 60% of them were never going to hire us. They wanted $99 tax prep, not a CPA."
> — Michael R., Managing Partner

Before implementing the platform:
- Leads per month: 50
- Qualified leads: 20 (40%)
- Close rate: 15%
- Time spent on unqualified leads: 30+ hours/month

---

## The Solution

Michael implemented [Platform]'s lead scoring engine to automatically identify high-value prospects.

### Key Features Used:

**1. Lead State Engine**
Automatic categorization of leads into 5 states: Browsing, Curious, Evaluating, Advisory-Ready, and High-Leverage. Staff only see leads worth pursuing.

**2. Behavioral Signal Tracking**
27 signals tracked including business income, investment activity, complexity indicators, and commitment actions.

**3. High-Leverage Alerts**
Immediate notifications when a lead shows high-value indicators: business owner, high income, complex situation.

---

## The Results

After 4 months with the platform:

### By the Numbers:

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Leads per month | 50 | 50 | — |
| Qualified leads | 20 (40%) | 35 (70%) | +75% |
| Close rate | 15% | 21% | +40% |
| Time on unqualified leads | 30 hrs/mo | 8 hrs/mo | -73% |

### Revenue Impact:

**Before:** 50 leads × 40% qualified × 15% close × $800 avg = $2,400/month
**After:** 50 leads × 70% qualified × 21% close × $1,050 avg = $7,717/month

**Additional monthly revenue: $5,317**
**Additional annual revenue: $63,804**

---

## Key Moments

### The Turning Point:

> "We got a lead flagged as High-Leverage—business owner, $400K revenue, multi-state operations. Old process, that lead would've gotten the same generic follow-up as everyone else. Instead, I called within an hour with specific questions about their situation. They signed a $3,500 engagement that week."
> — Michael R.

---

## Summary

By implementing intelligent lead scoring, Michael's firm stopped wasting time on unqualified prospects and focused their energy on high-value opportunities. Close rates increased 40%, average engagement value increased 31%, and the team reclaimed 22 hours per month previously spent on leads that never converted.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Not all leads deserve equal attention
- Business owners and complex filers are highest-value targets
- Automatic scoring eliminates guesswork and reduces wasted effort
