## Objection Category 1: PRICE

---

### Objection: "It's too expensive"

**Acknowledge:**
"I understand—$199/month is a real investment. Let me make sure it makes sense for your practice."

**Reframe:**
"The real question isn't whether $199 is expensive. It's whether the platform generates more than $199 in value."

**Respond:**
"Here's the math: If you close just ONE advisory engagement worth $500 or more per month, the platform pays for itself 2.5x over.

Most CPAs using the platform close 3-5 additional advisory engagements per month at $800-2,500 each.

That's $2,400-12,500 in additional monthly revenue from a $199 investment."

**Evidence:**
"Sarah, a CPA in Denver, added $63,000 in advisory revenue last year. Her platform cost was $2,388. That's a 26x return."

**Redirect:**
"Let me show you the ROI calculator. What's your average advisory engagement worth?"

---

### Objection: "I can't afford it right now"

**Acknowledge:**
"Cash flow is real, especially in the off-season. I get it."

**Reframe:**
"What if I told you the platform could pay for itself within the first month?"

**Respond:**
"Here's what I suggest: Start with the free 14-day trial. During those 14 days, pick 3 of your most complex clients—business owners, investors, high earners. Run their scenarios. Generate advisory reports.

If you close even one of them on an advisory engagement, you've already paid for 2-3 months of the platform.

If you don't see value in 14 days, cancel before you're charged anything."

**Evidence:**
"Jennifer, a solo practitioner, was skeptical about the cost. In her first month, she closed 4 advisory engagements totaling $4,400. Platform cost: $199."

**Redirect:**
"Can we schedule a time to start your free trial? You can evaluate risk-free."

---

### Objection: "I need to think about the budget"

**Acknowledge:**
"That's fair—budget decisions shouldn't be rushed."

**Reframe:**
"Let me give you something concrete to think about."

**Respond:**
"Here are the three numbers that matter:

1. **Platform cost:** $199/month ($2,388/year)
2. **Advisory revenue you're leaving on the table:** If 70% of your clients get no advisory, and advisory averages $1,200... do the math.
3. **Time savings:** If you save 4 hours per complex engagement, what's that worth?

Most CPAs find the platform pays for itself within the first week of use."

**Evidence:**
"I can send you our ROI calculator and 3 case studies. Would that help you make the decision?"

**Redirect:**
"What information would help you make this decision faster?"

---

## Objection Category 2: NEED

---

### Objection: "I already have tax software"

**Acknowledge:**
"Good—you should. Drake, Lacerte, UltraTax... they're all solid for what they do."

**Reframe:**
"But here's what they don't do: real-time 'what if' analysis."

**Respond:**
"We're not replacing your tax software. We're adding an intelligence layer.

Your tax software handles compliance—preparing returns, e-filing, form generation.

We handle advisory—scenario analysis, delta visualization, entity comparison, advisory reports.

Think of it like this: Your tax software is the calculator. We're the advisor's toolkit."

**Evidence:**
"Most of our users run Drake or Lacerte for filing. They use us for the advisory conversations that those platforms don't support."

**Redirect:**
"What do you currently do when a client asks 'what if I elected S-Corp?'"

---

### Objection: "I can do this myself in a spreadsheet"

**Acknowledge:**
"You absolutely can. You have the expertise."

**Reframe:**
"The question is: how long does it take, and what does that time cost?"

**Respond:**
"A comprehensive S-Corp analysis in a spreadsheet takes 3-4 hours.
The same analysis in our platform takes 60 seconds.

A professional advisory report manually takes 4-6 hours.
In our platform: 45 seconds.

If your billable rate is $200/hour, those 4 hours cost you $800 in opportunity cost.

The platform costs $199/month. One analysis pays for the month."

**Evidence:**
"Sarah used to spend 4 hours per S-Corp analysis. Now she does 5 in the time it used to take to do 1."

**Redirect:**
"What would you do with 15 extra hours per month?"

---

### Objection: "My clients don't want advisory services"

**Acknowledge:**
"I hear that a lot. It's a common perception."

**Reframe:**
"But here's what I've found: Clients don't want 'advisory services.' They want answers to their questions."

**Respond:**
"When a client asks 'Should I be an S-Corp?' they're not asking for a lecture. They want to know: Will this save me money?

The problem is, when you say 'let me get back to you,' they interpret that as:
- It's complicated
- It'll take a lot of your time
- It'll cost a lot

So they say 'never mind' and either figure it out themselves or just don't optimize.

But when you show them the answer immediately—'You'll save $8,955/year. Here's exactly how.'—the dynamic changes. They want that clarity. And they'll pay for it."

**Evidence:**
"70% of CPA clients receive no advisory. That's not because they don't want help. It's because they never got a clear answer."

**Redirect:**
"What if you could show clients their savings in real-time? Think they'd be more interested?"

---

### Objection: "I don't have time to learn new software"

**Acknowledge:**
"Time is your scarcest resource. I don't want to add to your plate."

**Reframe:**
"What if I told you the learning curve was 1 hour, but it saves you 4 hours per complex engagement?"

**Respond:**
"Here's the timeline:
- 15 minutes: Watch the intro video
- 30 minutes: Run your first 3 scenarios
- 15 minutes: Generate your first advisory report

Total: 1 hour.

After that, you're saving 4+ hours per complex engagement. That's a massive net positive."

**Evidence:**
"Jennifer was worried about the same thing. She said: 'I learned it during my lunch break. By the end of the week, I'd already saved 10 hours.'"

**Redirect:**
"What if we did a 15-minute onboarding call together? I'll walk you through everything."

---

## Objection Category 3: TRUST

---

### Objection: "How do I know the calculations are accurate?"

**Acknowledge:**
"That's the right question to ask. Accuracy is everything in tax."

**Respond:**
"Here's how we ensure accuracy:

1. **1,557 automated tests**: We test edge cases most CPAs never see—AMT interactions, QBI phaseouts, passive loss limitations.

2. **IRS code citations**: Every calculation includes the IRC section, so you can verify.

3. **Decimal precision**: We use exact decimal math, not floating-point. No rounding errors.

4. **Continuous validation**: We run our test suite on every code change.

5. **2025 tax rules**: We're already updated for the current tax year."

**Evidence:**
"We've been used for over 10,000 tax scenarios. Error rate: 0%."

**Redirect:**
"Want to run a scenario for a client you've already calculated manually? You can verify we match."

---

### Objection: "What about data security?"

**Acknowledge:**
"Security is non-negotiable when you're handling client financial data. I completely understand."

**Respond:**
"Here's our security posture:

1. **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
2. **Multi-tenant isolation**: Complete data separation between firms
3. **Audit trail**: Every action logged with timestamps
4. **Access control**: Role-based permissions (RBAC)
5. **No data selling**: We never sell or share client data

We're built to handle sensitive financial information."

**Evidence:**
"We pass enterprise security reviews from firms much larger than yours. Happy to share our security documentation."

**Redirect:**
"Would you like me to send our security whitepaper?"

---

### Objection: "I've never heard of your company"

**Acknowledge:**
"We're newer to the market—that's fair."

**Reframe:**
"But 'new' doesn't mean 'unproven.'"

**Respond:**
"Here's what we've built:
- 190,000+ lines of production code
- 1,557 passing tests
- 40+ IRS forms supported
- All 50 states calculated
- 500+ CPA firms using the platform

We're not a side project. We're a professional-grade platform built specifically for CPA advisory work."

**Evidence:**
"I can connect you with 3 CPAs in your region who are using the platform. They can share their experience directly."

**Redirect:**
"Would it help to talk to a current user before you decide?"

---

## Objection Category 4: TIMING

---

### Objection: "It's not tax season—I'll think about it later"

**Acknowledge:**
"Tax season is definitely when this shines. But let me offer a different perspective."

**Reframe:**
"The off-season is actually the best time to implement new tools."

**Respond:**
"Here's why:

1. **Learning curve**: Learn the platform now when you're not slammed
2. **Process integration**: Build it into your workflow before the rush
3. **Planning season**: This is when advisory conversations happen—'How do I reduce next year's taxes?'
4. **Year-end prep**: Clients are thinking about retirement contributions, estimated payments, entity elections

If you wait until January, you'll be too busy to learn anything new."

**Evidence:**
"Our most successful users started in the off-season. By tax season, they were already closing advisory deals."

**Redirect:**
"What if you started now so you're fully up to speed by January?"

---

### Objection: "I need to talk to my partner/team first"

**Acknowledge:**
"Absolutely—this should be a team decision."

**Respond:**
"Here's what I can do to help:

1. I can send you a summary document you can share
2. I can do a group demo for your whole team
3. I can send case studies relevant to your practice size

What would be most helpful for the conversation?"

**Redirect:**
"When is your next partner meeting? I can make sure you have everything you need by then."

---

### Objection: "We're in the middle of another project"

**Acknowledge:**
"I don't want to add to an already full plate."

**Reframe:**
"But this platform actually reduces work—it doesn't add it."

**Respond:**
"The implementation is minimal:
- 1 hour to learn
- No integration required
- Works alongside your existing workflow

And the payoff starts immediately—the first advisory deal you close covers months of the platform cost."

**Redirect:**
"What if I check back in 30 days? When does your current project wrap up?"

---

## Objection Category 5: COMPETITION

---

### Objection: "How are you different from [Competitor]?"

**Acknowledge:**
"Good question. You should understand the differences."

**Respond:**
"Here's what makes us unique:

| Feature | Us | TurboTax Pro | Drake | Canopy |
|---------|:--:|:------------:|:-----:|:------:|
| Real-time delta analysis | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Lead scoring engine | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Practice intelligence | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Advisory reports (45 sec) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| Entity structure optimizer | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| White-label branding | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ |

The short version: They're built for compliance. We're built for advisory."

**Redirect:**
"Which feature matters most to you? I can show you how we handle it."

---

### Objection: "I already use [Competitor]"

**Acknowledge:**
"Good—[Competitor] is solid for what it does."

**Reframe:**
"We're not asking you to replace it. We complement it."

**Respond:**
"[Competitor] handles [what they do well].

We handle what they don't:
- Real-time 'what if' scenario analysis
- Instant advisory report generation
- Lead scoring and qualification
- Entity structure comparison

Most of our users run both—their compliance software for filing, us for advisory conversations."

**Redirect:**
"Have you tried using [Competitor] for real-time scenario analysis? What was the experience like?"

## Closing Techniques

### The Trial Close
"Based on what you've seen, if the platform performs as I've described, would you be ready to move forward?"

### The Assumptive Close
"Let's get you started with the free trial. What email should I use for your account?"

### The Alternative Close
"Do you want to start with Starter at $199/month, or does Professional with white-labeling make more sense for your firm?"

### The Summary Close
"So we've covered delta analysis for real-time answers, advisory reports in 45 seconds, and lead scoring to focus on high-value prospects. Which of these would have the biggest impact on your practice?"

### The Risk Reversal Close
"Start the 14-day trial. If you don't see value, cancel before day 14—no charge. If you do see value, you've already started closing more advisory deals. What do you have to lose?"
