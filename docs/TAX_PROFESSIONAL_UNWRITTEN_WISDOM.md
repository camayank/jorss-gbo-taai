## Introduction: The Stuff We Don't Write Down

After 25+ years of doing taxes, there's a lot we know that doesn't make it into official reports or advice letters. Some of it is too casual, some feels obvious to us but isn't to clients, and some we just don't want to sound preachy about.

But these insights are **gold** - they can save you thousands, help you avoid trouble, and make your financial life easier.

This document is like having a beer with your CPA and asking, "What do you REALLY think?"

## CATEGORY 1: IRS AUDIT REALITIES (The Real Story)

### What Actually Triggers Audits (vs What People Think)

**The Myth**: "The IRS audits everyone with big deductions!"

**The Reality**:
The IRS is broke. Seriously. Their budget has been cut repeatedly and they're running on fumes. In 2025, less than 0.4% of returns under $200K income get audited. That's 4 in 1,000.

**What Actually Gets Flagged**:

1. **Math that doesn't make sense**
   - Reporting $80K income but claiming $20K in charitable donations
   - Running a business that loses money for 5+ years straight
   - Having $5K in mortgage interest but claiming a $2M home office

   *Plain English*: If a human looks at it and goes "wait, what?", you're getting a letter.

2. **Round numbers everywhere**
   - Mileage: exactly 10,000 miles
   - Business expenses: exactly $5,000
   - Charitable: exactly $2,500

   *Plain English*: Life isn't round. Real expenses are $4,873.42, not $5,000.00.

3. **Schedule C businesses that look like hobbies**
   - Photography "business" that loses money every year
   - Consulting "business" with $2K income, $15K in expenses
   - MLM/network marketing with huge losses

   *Plain English*: If it doesn't make money for 3 out of 5 years, the IRS calls it a hobby and disallows everything.

4. **Home office deduction (but not for the reason you think)**
   - It's not the deduction itself - it's that people often mess it up
   - Claiming 50% of home for office when it's actually 8%
   - Claiming it when you have another job with an office

   *Plain English*: Take it if you qualify, but measure correctly and be honest.

5. **Large cash transactions**
   - Reporting $50K+ in cash income (bars, restaurants, salons)
   - Not reporting bank deposits that don't match your tax return

   *Plain English*: The IRS gets copies of your bank statements. They know what went in.

**What DOESN'T Trigger Audits** (Despite Urban Legends):

- ❌ Taking the Earned Income Credit (if you qualify, take it!)
- ❌ Large charitable donations (if you have receipts and they're reasonable for your income)
- ❌ Itemizing instead of standard deduction
- ❌ Having a side business (if it's real and profitable)
- ❌ Large refunds (they actually prefer giving refunds - it means you overpaid all year)

**My Honest Take**:
If you're honest, keep receipts, and your numbers make sense relative to your life, you'll probably never get audited. And if you do, it's usually just "send us proof of X" and you're done.

I've had clients stress for MONTHS about audits that turned into a 15-minute phone call.

### If You DO Get Audited: The Real Process

**What the IRS Letter Actually Means**:

1. **"We need more information about [X]"**
   - Translation: Send us receipts, we'll look at them, done
   - Not scary, just annoying
   - 80% of "audits" are just this

2. **"We made changes to your return"**
   - Translation: We think you owe more, here's why
   - You can agree or disagree
   - If you disagree, send proof, they'll usually fix it

3. **"Please come to our office"**
   - Translation: This is more complex, let's talk in person
   - Only happens for big issues or repeat problems
   - Bring your CPA/EA - seriously, don't go alone

**What I Tell Clients (But Don't Write)**:

- The IRS agent is just a person doing their job. Be nice, be professional, don't argue.
- They actually have some discretion. If you're polite and organized, they'll often meet you halfway.
- The first answer isn't always final. You can appeal (and often win if you have good reason).
- Penalties can usually be waived if you have "reasonable cause" (sick, natural disaster, first time offender).
- They're SLOW. You'll wait weeks between letters. Don't panic in the meantime.

**The Phrase That Solves 90% of IRS Problems**:
"I made a mistake. Here's proof of what it should have been. I'm sorry for the confusion."

IRS agents are human. Own up, show proof, be respectful. You'll be amazed how often it just... goes away.

---

## CATEGORY 2: TIMING STRATEGIES (When Matters More Than What)

### The December/January Game

**What I Tell Clients Over Coffee**:

You have more control over your taxes than you think. It's not about finding loopholes - it's about timing.

**If You're Getting a Big Raise in 2026** (or expecting higher income):

**DO in December 2025**:
- Pay January's mortgage early (deduct at lower 2025 rate)
- Pay property tax bill for next year if allowed
- Make charitable donations (less valuable next year when you're in higher bracket)
- Collect bonuses or freelance payments NOW (taxed at lower 2025 rate)

**DON'T do in December 2025**:
- Make big equipment purchases for business (wait for January - deduct at higher 2026 rate)
- Pay business expenses if you can wait (more valuable in 2026 at higher rate)

**If You're Expecting Lower Income in 2026** (retirement, job loss, sabbatical):

**DO in December 2025**:
- Delay income to January (taxed at lower 2026 rate)
- Buy business equipment NOW (deduct at higher 2025 rate)
- Pay all deductible expenses NOW (more valuable at higher rate)
- Consider Roth conversion (pay tax at high rate before it drops)

**Real Example I Don't Usually Write**:

Client retiring in January 2026:
- 2025 income: $150K (24% bracket)
- 2026 income: $40K (12% bracket)

If he waits until January to buy the $20K tractor for his rental property:
- Saves at 12% rate = $2,400
- Instead of saving at 24% rate = $4,800
- He just left $2,400 on the table by buying in December instead of January

**I tell him**: "Wait 3 weeks. Seriously. It's worth $2,400."

---

### The "Right Before I File" Moves

**Things You Can Still Do AFTER December 31**:

Most people think the year ends on December 31 and that's it. NOPE.

**You Have Until April 15** (or your filing deadline) to:

1. **Contribute to Traditional IRA** ($7,000 in 2025)
   - Deducts from 2025 taxes even though you contribute in 2026
   - Just mark it "2025 contribution" when you send the money

2. **Contribute to HSA** ($8,300 family in 2025)
   - Same deal - deducts from 2025, contribute by April 15

3. **Contribute to SEP-IRA** (if self-employed - up to $69K in 2025)
   - You actually have until your return filing deadline (with extensions: October 15!)
   - This is HUGE for self-employed folks

4. **Set up Solo 401(k)**
   - Must be established by December 31
   - But you can FUND it until your filing deadline
   - Don't let anyone tell you it's too late

**What This Means**:

You're doing your taxes in March 2026 and realize "crap, I'm going to owe $5K".

You can IMMEDIATELY contribute $7,000 to your IRA, reduce your taxable income, and now you owe zero (or get a refund).

**I tell clients**: "Don't panic about year-end deadlines. You have more time than you think."

---

## CATEGORY 3: DOCUMENTATION (What Actually Matters)

### The Receipt Paradox

**The Myth**: "You need receipts for everything!"

**The Reality**: You need receipts for some things. For others, the IRS accepts reasonable records.

**Where You ABSOLUTELY Need Receipts**:

1. **Any single charitable donation over $250**
   - Must have written acknowledgment from charity
   - Your bank statement doesn't count
   - No exceptions, I've tried

2. **Any business meal or entertainment**
   - Receipt AND note about who, what, why
   - "Lunch with client Sarah - discussed project X"
   - Without the note, they'll disallow it even with receipt

3. **Any non-cash donation over $500**
   - Need written record, date, condition, value
   - Over $5,000? Need formal appraisal
   - Old clothes to Goodwill? Estimate is fine under $500

4. **Any expense over $75**
   - Technically required by law
   - In practice, bank statement + reasonable explanation often works
   - But why risk it?

**Where You DON'T Need Receipts** (But Keep Records):

1. **Mileage**
   - Just keep a log: Date, miles, purpose
   - "Jan 15: 23 miles to client site downtown"
   - Apps like MileIQ make this brain-dead easy

2. **Home office**
   - Measure your space, take a photo, done
   - No receipts needed - it's just math

3. **Standard deduction**
   - You're literally taking the standard amount
   - No receipts needed at all

**What I Tell Clients**:

"Take a photo with your phone. Boom, you have a receipt."

Seriously, in 2025, there's no excuse. Snap a pic, it uploads to cloud, searchable, done. The IRS accepts phone photos.

---

### The "Reasonable Person" Test

**What Auditors Actually Think**:

When the IRS looks at your return, they're asking: "Would a reasonable person believe this?"

**Examples That Pass the Test**:

- You make $100K and donate $5K to charity → Reasonable
- You drive 15K miles/year and 8K are business → Reasonable
- You have a 2,000 sq ft home and 200 sq ft office → Reasonable

**Examples That Fail**:

- You make $40K and donate $15K to charity → They're going to look
- You drive 50K miles/year and 48K are business → Really? Only 2K personal?
- You have a 1,500 sq ft home and 750 sq ft office → Half your house is office? Doubt it.

**The Phrase I Use**:

"If you were the IRS agent, would you buy it?"

If the answer is "hmm, maybe not", then fix it or don't claim it.

---

### The Documentation I Wish Everyone Kept (But Don't)

**Things That Will Save Your Ass Someday**:

1. **A simple spreadsheet of your business income/expenses**
   - Updated monthly (takes 10 minutes)
   - When tax time comes: already done
   - If audited: looks super professional

2. **Photos of your home office**
   - Date stamped
   - Shows it's exclusively business use
   - Defeats the #1 audit challenge

3. **Email confirmations of donations**
   - Most charities email you instantly
   - Save in a folder: "2025 Donations"
   - April comes: you already have everything

4. **Mileage log (if you drive for business)**
   - 90% of self-employed people wing this
   - Then panic at tax time
   - Use an app - it's literally automatic

**Real Talk**:

I've seen people lose $5,000+ in deductions because they couldn't prove it. They 100% did it, spent the money, have bank statements... but no actual receipts or notes.

The IRS doesn't care about your bank statement. They want proof it was legit.

## CATEGORY 4: STRATEGIC LIFE PLANNING

### When to Tell Your CPA About Life Changes

**Tell Me BEFORE You**:

1. **Get married or divorced**
   - Filing status = huge tax implications
   - Might want to marry in December vs January (or vice versa)
   - Same with divorce - timing matters

2. **Have a baby**
   - Born December 31 = full year of deductions/credits
   - Born January 1 = wait a whole year
   - I've had clients schedule C-sections for December 30

3. **Buy a house**
   - Deductible: mortgage interest, property tax
   - Might push you into itemizing territory
   - Timing of purchase can matter

4. **Start a business**
   - Even a side hustle
   - Opens up tons of deductions
   - But also estimated tax payments to think about

5. **Get a big raise/bonus**
   - Need to adjust withholding
   - Might want to front-load 401(k)
   - Could change our whole strategy

6. **Inherit money**
   - Timing of distributions matters
   - Might affect college financial aid
   - Estate tax issues if large

7. **Go back to school**
   - Education credits worth up to $2,500
   - Might make sense to front-load tuition
   - Lifetime Learning Credit for non-degree courses

**Why This Matters**:

I can't help you if I don't know. And by the time you tell me in April, it's too late to do anything about it.

**Real Example**:

Client got married in January. If they'd waited until December (11 months later), they'd have saved $4,000 in taxes that year.

Would I tell them to delay their wedding for taxes? Hell no. But would I tell them to RUN THE NUMBERS first? Yes.

### The "Is It Worth It?" Conversation

**Things That Sound Good But Aren't Worth The Hassle**:

1. **Deducting $20 of office supplies**
   - Seriously?
   - Takes more time to track than it saves
   - Skip it unless you're already tracking business expenses

2. **Sales tax deduction** (when you take income tax deduction)
   - You can deduct state INCOME tax or SALES tax, not both
   - Sales tax is only better if you bought a car or boat
   - Otherwise, income tax is easier

3. **Casualty loss deduction** (small amounts)
   - Used to be great, now basically useless
   - Only deductible if federally declared disaster
   - And even then, limits are harsh

4. **Claiming every single mileage trip**
   - 3 miles to the bank? 5 miles to office supply store?
   - The gas you use tracking this stuff costs more than you save
   - Just claim the obvious stuff (client visits, job sites, etc.)

**Things That ARE Worth It** (Even Though They're Annoying):

1. **Health Savings Account (HSA)**
   - Yes, changing insurance is annoying
   - But triple tax advantage (deduct, grow tax-free, withdraw tax-free)
   - Worth $2,000+/year in tax savings

2. **Maximizing 401(k)**
   - Yes, it reduces your paycheck
   - But it's literally free money (22% instant return from tax savings)
   - Plus employer match (often 50-100% return)

3. **Keeping mileage logs** (if you drive a lot for business)
   - Annoying daily, but worth $3,000-$5,000/year
   - Use an app - takes zero effort

4. **Bunching charitable donations**
   - Annoying to think ahead
   - But saves $500-$1,000/year by itemizing one year, standard the next

**My Rule of Thumb**:

If it takes more than 30 minutes and saves less than $100, skip it.

Life's too short to chase $20 deductions.

## CATEGORY 5: RELATIONSHIP WITH THE IRS

### The IRS Isn't Out to Get You

**The Mindset Shift**:

Most people think: "IRS = enemy, trying to take my money"

**Reality**: IRS = overwhelmed bureaucracy, just trying to collect what's legally owed

**What This Means in Practice**:

1. **They'll work with you if you're honest**
   - Can't pay your tax bill? They have payment plans (easy to set up online)
   - Made a mistake? File an amended return, they'll fix it
   - Missed a deadline? Penalties can be waived (first-time forgiveness is a thing)

2. **They're not looking to trap you**
   - Gray area rules? They want you to interpret reasonably, not exploit
   - If you're honest and transparent, they'll usually meet you halfway
   - The "gotcha" mentality is rare - they just want compliance

3. **Their customer service is actually... okay**
   - Tax Advocate Service (TAS) - free help if IRS is being unreasonable
   - Online account - see transcripts, payment history, notices
   - Phone support - yes you'll wait 45 minutes, but they'll usually help

**Stories I Share But Don't Write**:

- Client owed $30K, was terrified. IRS set up a $500/month payment plan over the phone in 20 minutes. No liens, no drama.

- Client missed filing for 3 years (depression, life chaos). We filed all 3 years, requested first-time penalty abatement, IRS waived $5,000 in penalties. Done.

- Client got a scary letter saying they owed $50K. Turned out to be a mistake (IRS didn't process a payment). One phone call, fixed.

**The Attitude That Works**:

"I want to do this right. Can you help me understand what you need?"

Not: "You can't make me!" or "This is unfair!"

---

### When to Fight, When to Fold

**Fight If**:

1. **You're clearly right and have proof**
   - IRS says you didn't report income, but you have the W-2
   - IRS disallowed a deduction, but you have all the receipts
   - IRS made a math error

   → File amended return or appeal notice. You'll win.

2. **The penalty is due to reasonable cause**
   - You were in the hospital
   - Natural disaster affected you
   - First-time mistake and you've been compliant for years

   → Request penalty abatement. Often granted.

3. **The amount is significant**
   - Disputing $5,000+? Worth the time and possible CPA fees
   - Disputing $200? Probably not

   → Cost-benefit analysis

**Fold If**:

1. **You're technically wrong but didn't realize it**
   - You took a deduction you weren't eligible for
   - You didn't know the rule
   - No proof/receipts

   → Just pay it. Lesson learned.

2. **The cost to fight exceeds the amount in question**
   - Hiring a tax attorney for a $300 dispute? No.
   - Spending 20 hours of your time for a $500 dispute? Probably no.

   → Do the math

3. **It's your second or third "mistake"**
   - IRS is less forgiving if you've done this before
   - Repeated "errors" look like fraud
   - Not worth the audit risk

   → Pay up, fix your processes

**The Gray Area** (Where I Earn My Fees):

Some tax law is genuinely unclear. In those cases:

- Conservative interpretation = less risk, but you might overpay
- Aggressive interpretation = more risk, but lower tax

I help clients decide based on their risk tolerance. No right answer, just trade-offs.

---

## CATEGORY 6: MONEY PSYCHOLOGY

### Why People Don't Save On Taxes (Even When It's Easy)

**The Dirty Secret of Tax Planning**:

The biggest tax savings aren't complicated. They're:
- Contribute to 401(k)
- Open an HSA
- Track your business expenses
- Keep receipts

**So Why Don't People Do It?**

1. **Present bias** - feels like a sacrifice NOW for benefit LATER
   - Saving $2,000 in taxes feels less real than reducing your paycheck by $400/month

2. **Status quo bias** - "this is how I've always done it"
   - Even when "it" is costing you thousands

3. **Complexity aversion** - "too much hassle"
   - Even when "hassle" is 10 minutes to set up auto-contribution

4. **Optimism bias** - "I'll make more money next year"
   - So they don't implement tax savings, figuring they'll "make up for it"
   - (They never do)

**What I Tell Clients** (When They'll Listen):

Taxes are the single largest expense most people have. Bigger than housing, bigger than food, bigger than their car.

Yet they'll spend 20 hours researching which $500 TV to buy, but won't spend 2 hours optimizing their taxes to save $3,000.

The math doesn't math.

---

### The Refund Addiction

**The Uncomfortable Truth**:

Getting a big refund feels AMAZING. It's like found money!

But it's not. It's YOUR money that you lent to the government interest-free all year.

**The Math**:

- $6,000 refund = you overpaid by $500/month
- If you'd adjusted withholding and kept that $500/month in a HYSA at 5%:
  - You'd have earned $150 in interest
  - Plus, you'd have had the money all year for emergencies

**Why People Do It Anyway**:

1. **Forced savings** - "If I don't overpay, I'll just spend it"
2. **Loss aversion** - "I'd rather get a refund than risk owing"
3. **Mental accounting** - "Refund = windfall, not my regular money"

**My Take**:

I get it. If overwithholding is the only way you save money, fine. But don't pretend it's optimal.

Better: Set up auto-transfer of $500/month to a savings account. Same forced savings, but YOU earn the interest.

---

### The "My Friend's CPA Said..." Syndrome

**Every. Single. Year.**

"My friend's CPA said they can deduct their Netflix subscription as a business expense."

**The Response I Want to Give**:

"Your friend's CPA is either:
a) Lying to impress your friend
b) Being very aggressive and hoping not to get caught
c) Has facts you're not aware of (like friend is a film critic)
d) Is not actually a CPA and doesn't know what they're talking about"

**The Response I Actually Give**:

"Every situation is unique. What works for them may not apply to you. Let's focus on maximizing YOUR tax savings within YOUR facts."

**The Pattern**:

People remember the most extreme thing they've ever heard someone claim as a deduction, then assume they can do it too.

**Examples**:

- "My neighbor deducts his pool as a medical expense!"
  → (Neighbor has severe arthritis, doctor prescribed aquatic therapy, has medical documentation)

- "My friend writes off all his meals!"
  → (Friend is a food blogger, literally reviewing restaurants for work)

- "My uncle hasn't paid taxes in 10 years!"
  → (Uncle is committing tax fraud and will eventually get caught)

**The Truth**:

Tax law is contextual. Just because someone CAN deduct something doesn't mean YOU can.

---

## CATEGORY 7: STATE TAX QUIRKS

### The State Nobody Talks About

**Federal taxes get all the attention. State taxes quietly eat you alive.**

**California** (My Example Because It's Extreme):

- 13.3% top rate - higher than most countries
- Taxes capital gains as ordinary income (fed gives you 0-20% rates, CA says "nope, full freight")
- No deduction for federal taxes paid
- Community property rules mess with divorce and inheritance

**If I were advising someone moving to California**:

"Realize the high salary you're taking for that Bay Area job? About 13% of it goes to state taxes. Factor that in."

**If I were advising someone LEAVING California**:

"They'll try to claim you're still a resident. Establish domicile HARD (rent, voter reg, license, car reg, all of it)."

**States With No Income Tax** (FL, TX, NV, WA, WY, SD, TN, NH, AK):

Sounds great! But:
- Higher property taxes (TX, NH)
- Higher sales taxes (TN)
- They get their money somehow

**What I Tell Clients**:

If you're self-employed or have flexibility, your state choice is worth $5,000-$30,000/year easily.

That's a lot of beach time in Florida vs California.

---

### The "Work From Home in a Different State" Mess

**The New Normal** (Post-2020):

You live in Florida, work for a New York company, work from home.

**Where do you pay taxes?**

**The Nightmare Scenario**:

- New York says: "Your employer is here, you pay NY taxes"
- Florida says: "You live here, no state income tax"
- You think: "Great, no state tax!"
- Reality: NY still wants their cut (and they're aggressive about it)

**The Rules** (Generally):

1. **If you're an employee**: taxes go to the state where you physically do the work
   - Exception: Some states have "convenience of employer" rules (NY, NE, PA)
   - These states tax you even if you WFH in another state

2. **If you're self-employed**: taxes go to where you live
   - Unless you have clients in multiple states
   - Then it gets messy

**What I Tell Clients**:

If you're moving states or working remotely, talk to me FIRST. State tax law is a minefield.

---

## CATEGORY 8: RETIREMENT PLANNING (The Stuff Nobody Explains Well)

### Roth vs Traditional: The Real Conversation

**The Textbook Answer**:

"If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, do Roth. If lower, do Traditional."

**The Reality**:

Nobody knows their future tax rate. So that advice is useless.

**My Actual Advice**:

1. **If you're young** (20s-30s) and in a low bracket (12% or less):
   → Roth. You're paying tax at the lowest rate you'll ever see.

2. **If you're high-income** (24%+ bracket):
   → Traditional. Take the deduction now, worry about withdrawal taxes later (probably still better).

3. **If you're mid-career** (22% bracket):
   → Mix of both. Hedge your bets.

**The Part I Don't Usually Say**:

Roth has one HUGE advantage nobody mentions: flexibility in retirement.

With Traditional, you MUST take withdrawals (RMDs) at age 73. Even if you don't need the money. And it's all taxable.

With Roth, you can let it sit forever. No RMDs. Grows tax-free. Heirs inherit it tax-free.

So if you think you'll have plenty of money in retirement (pension, rental income, taxable accounts), Roth might be better EVEN IF you pay more tax now.

---

### The "Retire at 62 vs 65 vs 67" Tax Math

**Everyone focuses on Social Security**. They should focus on healthcare.

**The Gap Years** (Before Medicare at 65):

If you retire at 62, you need health insurance for 3 years. It's expensive:
- Private insurance: $800-$1,500/month
- COBRA (from employer): $1,000-$2,000/month
- ACA Marketplace: $0-$1,500/month (depending on income)

**The Tax Planning Opportunity**:

ACA subsidies are based on income. If you keep your income low enough:
- $50K for married couple = heavy subsidies
- $70K for married couple = moderate subsidies
- $90K for married couple = minimal subsidies

**So:**

In the years between retirement and Medicare, you want LOW income.

**Strategies**:

1. **Convert Traditional IRA to Roth** in these years
   - You're paying tax at a low rate (12%)
   - Plus you get ACA subsidies
   - Later in life, you'll be in a higher bracket

2. **Harvest capital gains at 0%**
   - Same logic - low income years are valuable
   - Reset cost basis higher

3. **Delay Social Security** until 70
   - Increases benefit by 8%/year
   - Keeps income low in early retirement years

**What I Tell Clients**:

The years from 62-72 are the most tax-efficient years of your life if you plan it right.

Don't just "retire" - PLAN your retirement income year by year.

---

## CATEGORY 9: SMALL BUSINESS REALITIES

### The "Should I Form an LLC/S-Corp?" Question

**What Everyone Asks**: "Should I form an LLC?"

**What They Should Ask**: "Should I elect S-Corp treatment?"

**The Confusion**:

- LLC = legal structure (protects personal assets)
- S-Corp = tax election (can save on self-employment taxes)
- You can be an LLC taxed as an S-Corp (most common)

**The Math**:

As a sole proprietor:
- Net income: $80,000
- Self-employment tax (15.3%): $12,240
- Income tax: ~$8,000
- **Total tax: $20,240**

As an S-Corp:
- Salary to yourself: $50,000
- Distributions: $30,000
- Self-employment tax (only on salary): $7,650
- Income tax: ~$8,000
- **Total tax: $15,650**
- **Savings: $4,590**

**But There's a Catch**:

S-Corp = more complexity:
- Payroll processing ($500-$1,500/year)
- Quarterly reports
- More tax filings
- More accounting fees

**My Rule of Thumb**:

- Under $50K profit: Stay sole proprietor, not worth it
- $50K-$100K profit: Consider S-Corp, probably worth it
- Over $100K profit: Definitely S-Corp, big savings

**What I Don't Write** (But Tell Clients):

The S-Corp election is AMAZING for tax savings, but it's also a pain in the ass.

You'll curse me every time you have to do payroll. But you'll thank me at tax time.

### The Home Office Deduction (Stop Being Afraid of It)

**The Myth**: "Home office deduction = audit flag!"

**The Reality**: It's 2025. The IRS knows people work from home. They don't care.

**What Triggers Problems**:

1. **Claiming 50% of your home**
   - Unless you run a daycare, no way
   - Be reasonable

2. **Claiming it when you have an office provided by your employer**
   - This doesn't qualify - even if you work from home sometimes
   - "Convenience of employee" doesn't count

3. **Using the space for personal stuff**
   - Kids do homework there? Not exclusive use.
   - Guest bedroom that's also your office? Doesn't count.

**What's Allowed**:

- Dedicated space (doesn't have to be whole room)
- Exclusively for business
- Regular use
- Principal place of business (or meet clients there)

**The Simplified Method** (Why You Should Use It):

- $5/sq ft up to 300 sq ft
- Max deduction: $1,500
- No depreciation, no complicated allocation
- Easy to defend in audit

**My Take**:

If you legitimately work from home and have dedicated space, take it. Don't leave $1,500 on the table because of unfounded fear.

Just measure honestly and you're fine.

## CATEGORY 10: THE BIG PICTURE

### The 80/20 Rule of Tax Savings

**80% of tax savings come from 20% of strategies**:

1. **Max out tax-advantaged accounts** (401k, IRA, HSA)
   → Saves: $2,000-$10,000/year depending on income

2. **Time income/deductions** strategically
   → Saves: $500-$5,000/year

3. **Take every credit you qualify for** (child tax, education, EITC)
   → Saves: $2,000-$6,000/year

4. **Track business expenses** if self-employed
   → Saves: $2,000-$15,000/year

5. **Itemize when beneficial**
   → Saves: $500-$3,000/year

**Everything else** - fancy trusts, complicated strategies, exotic deductions - is the other 20%.

**What This Means**:

If you do these 5 things, you're probably capturing 80% of available savings.

The rest is either:
- Not applicable to you
- Too complex to be worth it
- Tiny amounts (<$100)

**My Advice**:

Master the basics. Then, if you want to optimize further, fine. But don't skip the basics to chase exotic strategies.

### When You Actually Need a CPA (vs TurboTax)

**Do It Yourself (TurboTax, FreeTaxUSA, etc.) If**:

- W-2 employee only
- Take standard deduction
- No investments besides a bank account
- No side business
- No major life changes

**Hire Someone If**:

- Self-employed (Schedule C, partnership, S-Corp)
- Own rental property
- Sold a house
- Have stock options/RSUs
- Multi-state income
- Trust beneficiary
- High income ($200K+) with complicated finances

**The ROI Calculation**:

Good CPA costs $500-$2,000 depending on complexity.

If they save you more than they cost, worth it.

**What You're Paying For**:

- Not just the return
- Strategic advice during the year
- Audit protection/help
- Peace of mind you didn't miss something

**My Take**:

TurboTax is great at doing what you tell it to do. It's terrible at telling you what you SHOULD do.

That's what you pay us for.

### The Single Best Tax Move Most People Ignore

**After 25 years, here it is**:

**Increase your 401(k) contribution by 1% every time you get a raise.**

That's it. That's the tweet.

**The Math**:

- You get a 3% raise
- Increase 401(k) by 1%
- Still take home more money (2% raise in paycheck)
- But you're saving an extra 1% toward retirement
- Plus getting tax deduction on it

**Over a career** (30 years, $75K starting salary):

- Without this strategy: Save ~$450K in 401(k)
- With this strategy: Save ~$890K in 401(k)
- **Difference: $440K**

And you barely noticed because you never got used to the money in the first place.

**This is the #1 thing I tell young people**:

Every raise, bump your 401(k) by 1%. Your future self will buy me a beer.

## CONCLUSION: The Unwritten Rules, Summarized

After 25 years, here's what I know:

1. **The IRS isn't evil** - they're just underfunded and following rules. Be honest, they'll be fair.

2. **Timing is everything** - when you do something matters as much as what you do.

3. **Documentation beats memory** - keep good records, sleep well at night.

4. **Simple strategies compound** - max out 401(k), track expenses, take available credits. That's 80% of tax savings right there.

5. **Complexity isn't always better** - fancy strategies often aren't worth the hassle.

6. **Your situation is unique** - "my friend's CPA said..." is irrelevant. Focus on YOUR facts.

7. **State taxes matter** - sometimes more than federal. Don't ignore them.

8. **Future you will thank present you** - for saving in tax-advantaged accounts, keeping good records, and planning ahead.

9. **Tax law is gray** - reasonable people can disagree. Pick your comfort level with risk.

10. **Behavior beats knowledge** - knowing what to do is easy. Actually doing it consistently is hard.

**The Most Important Thing**:

Taxes aren't something you "do" once a year in April.

They're something you LIVE every day - in the decisions you make about savings, spending, timing, and planning.

The people who pay the least in taxes (legally) aren't the ones with the fanciest strategies.

They're the ones who think about taxes year-round and make small, smart decisions consistently.

Be one of those people.
