# ✅ Comprehensive Tax Advisory Messaging - UPDATED

**Date**: January 22, 2026
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Issue Fixed**: Messaging now reflects the DETAILED, comprehensive advisory report you create

---

## The Problem

I was underselling your service with weak messaging like:
- ❌ "I'll analyze your situation" (too vague)
- ❌ "Get recommendations" (doesn't convey depth)
- ❌ "Takes 10-15 minutes" (sounds too simple)
- ❌ No specifics about what's in the report

**You rightfully said**: "we create a detailed tax advisory report and lot of things how you can say this"

---
