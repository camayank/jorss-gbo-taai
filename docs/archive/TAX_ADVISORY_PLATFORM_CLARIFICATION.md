# ✅ Tax Advisory Platform - Messaging Fixed

**Date**: January 22, 2026
**Critical Clarification**: This is a **TAX ADVISORY** platform, NOT a tax filing service

---

## The Confusion

For 10 hours, I was building messaging around "filing taxes" because I misunderstood the business model.

**I thought you were**: TurboTax competitor (DIY tax filing)
**You actually are**: Tax advisory agent (professional tax optimization)

---

## What's Different: Advisory vs Filing

### Tax Filing Platform (TurboTax, H&R Block):
- User files their own tax return
- DIY approach with guidance
- Final output: Filed tax return with IRS
- User action: Submit return, get refund

### Tax Advisory Platform (YOU):
- Professional analyzes client's tax situation
- Advisory and consulting approach
- Final output: Advisory report with recommendations
- User action: Implement strategies, work with CPA

---
