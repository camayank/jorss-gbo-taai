## Guide 1: Self-Employment Tax Basics

### What Every Freelancer and Business Owner Should Know

---

**Who Is This For?**
Freelancers, independent contractors, gig workers, consultants, and small business owners who receive 1099 income.

---

### What Is Self-Employment Tax?

If you're self-employed, you pay **self-employment (SE) tax** in addition to income tax. This is how self-employed people pay into Social Security and Medicare.

**The Rate:** 15.3% of your net self-employment income
- 12.4% for Social Security (up to ${{SS_WAGE_BASE}})
- 2.9% for Medicare (no limit)

**Why So High?**
Employees split FICA taxes with their employer—each pays 7.65%. When you're self-employed, you pay both halves.

---

### How SE Tax Is Calculated

**Step 1:** Calculate your net self-employment income
(Gross income minus business expenses)

**Step 2:** Multiply by 92.35%
(This accounts for the "employer" portion)

**Step 3:** Apply the 15.3% rate

**Example:**
- Net profit: $100,000
- SE tax base: $100,000 × 92.35% = $92,350
- SE tax: $92,350 × 15.3% = **$14,130**

---

### Ways to Reduce Self-Employment Tax

**1. Maximize Business Deductions**
Every legitimate business expense reduces your SE tax. Common deductions:
- Home office
- Health insurance premiums
- Retirement contributions
- Business equipment
- Professional services
- Travel and meals (50%)

**2. Consider an S-Corp Election**
With an S-Corp, you pay SE tax only on your salary—not on distributions. This can save $5,000-$15,000+ annually depending on your income.

**3. Contribute to Retirement**
SEP-IRA, Solo 401(k), and SIMPLE IRA contributions reduce your SE income and your income tax.

**4. Time Income and Expenses**
Strategically timing when you invoice clients and pay expenses can help manage your tax liability.

---

### The S-Corp Question

**Should you become an S-Corp?**

An S-Corp can reduce SE tax by splitting your business income into salary (subject to SE tax) and distributions (not subject to SE tax).

**Example:**
- Business profit: $150,000
- As Sole Prop: SE tax on $150,000 = ~$21,200
- As S-Corp with $80,000 salary: SE tax on $80,000 = ~$12,200
- **Savings: ~$9,000/year**

**But there are costs:**
- Payroll processing ($500-2,000/year)
- Additional tax filings ($500-1,500/year)
- More complex bookkeeping

**General Rule:**
S-Corp often makes sense when net profit exceeds $50,000-60,000 and savings outweigh costs.

---

### Action Steps

1. Track all business expenses carefully
2. Estimate your quarterly tax payments
3. Consider retirement contributions
4. Ask your CPA about S-Corp analysis when profit exceeds $50K

## Guide 2: Understanding Your Tax Bracket

### Why Your "Bracket" Isn't What You Actually Pay

---

### The Common Misconception

Many people think: "I'm in the 24% bracket, so I pay 24% of my income in taxes."

**This is wrong.**

The US has a **progressive tax system**. You pay different rates on different portions of your income.

---

### How Tax Brackets Actually Work

**{{TAX_YEAR}} Tax Brackets (Single Filers):**

| Income Range | Tax Rate |
|--------------|----------|
| $0 - $11,925 | 10% |
| $11,926 - $48,475 | 12% |
| $48,476 - $103,350 | 22% |
| $103,351 - $197,300 | 24% |
| $197,301 - $250,500 | 32% |
| $250,501 - $626,350 | 35% |
| Over $626,350 | 37% |

**Example: Taxable Income of $80,000**

| Portion | Rate | Tax |
|---------|------|-----|
| First $11,925 | 10% | $1,193 |
| Next $36,550 ($11,926-$48,475) | 12% | $4,386 |
| Next $31,525 ($48,476-$80,000) | 22% | $6,936 |
| **Total** | | **$12,515** |

**Effective Rate:** $12,515 ÷ $80,000 = **15.6%**

Even though you're "in the 22% bracket," your effective rate is only 15.6%.

---

### Marginal Rate vs. Effective Rate

**Marginal Rate:** The rate on your NEXT dollar of income
- In the example above: 22%

**Effective Rate:** Your total tax divided by total income
- In the example above: 15.6%

**Why This Matters:**

When deciding whether to take on more income (a bonus, side gig, etc.), think about the marginal rate—that's what you'll pay on the additional income.

When comparing your overall tax burden, look at the effective rate.

---

### How Deductions Affect Your Bracket

Deductions reduce your taxable income, which can:
1. Lower your effective rate
2. Potentially move you to a lower bracket

**Example:**
If your income is $105,000 (24% bracket) and you contribute $10,000 to a 401(k), your taxable income becomes $95,000 (22% bracket).

That $10,000 would have been taxed at 24%. Now it's not taxed at all (until retirement).

---

### Key Takeaways

1. You don't pay your "bracket rate" on all your income
2. Effective rate is usually much lower than marginal rate
3. Deductions have the biggest impact at your marginal rate
4. Strategic planning can sometimes keep you in a lower bracket

## Guide 3: The QBI Deduction Explained

### How to Claim the 20% Pass-Through Deduction

---

### What Is the QBI Deduction?

The Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction lets eligible self-employed individuals and small business owners deduct up to **20% of their qualified business income**.

Also known as the "Section 199A deduction" or "pass-through deduction."

---

### Who Qualifies?

**Eligible Business Types:**
- Sole proprietorships
- Partnerships
- S-Corporations
- LLCs (taxed as sole prop, partnership, or S-Corp)
- Rental real estate (with certain rules)

**NOT Eligible:**
- C-Corporations
- W-2 wages (employee income)

---

### How Much Can You Deduct?

**Basic Calculation:**
20% of your Qualified Business Income

**But there are limitations...**

---

### Income Thresholds ({{TAX_YEAR}})

| Filing Status | Full Deduction | Phase-Out Range | No Deduction |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Single | Under ${{SINGLE_THRESHOLD}} | ${{SINGLE_THRESHOLD}}-${{SINGLE_LIMIT}} | Over ${{SINGLE_LIMIT}} |
| Married Filing Jointly | Under ${{MFJ_THRESHOLD}} | ${{MFJ_THRESHOLD}}-${{MFJ_LIMIT}} | Over ${{MFJ_LIMIT}} |

**Below the threshold:** Full 20% deduction (with some limits)
**In the phase-out range:** Partial deduction with complex rules
**Above the limit:** Additional limitations apply

---

### The SSTB Question

**SSTB = Specified Service Trade or Business**

Certain service businesses face stricter QBI rules at higher incomes.

**SSTBs include:**
- Health (doctors, dentists, etc.)
- Law
- Accounting
- Actuarial science
- Performing arts
- Consulting
- Athletics
- Financial services
- Brokerage services

**If you're an SSTB AND above the income threshold:**
Your QBI deduction is significantly limited or eliminated.

**If you're NOT an SSTB (or below the threshold):**
You can claim the full deduction regardless of business type.

---

### Example Calculation

**Freelance Web Developer:**
- Net business income: $100,000
- Filing status: Single
- Taxable income: $85,000 (below threshold)

**QBI Deduction:**
$100,000 × 20% = **$20,000 deduction**

**Tax Savings:**
$20,000 × 22% (marginal rate) = **$4,400 saved**

---

### Strategies to Maximize QBI

1. **Stay below thresholds** if possible (retirement contributions help)
2. **Separate SSTB and non-SSTB activities** if you have both
3. **Consider entity structure** (S-Corp can affect QBI calculation)
4. **Pay attention to W-2 wages** if you have employees (affects high-income limits)

---

### Key Takeaways

- QBI deduction can save you 20% × your marginal rate
- Income thresholds determine complexity of calculation
- SSTBs face special rules at higher incomes
- Strategic planning can maximize this valuable deduction

---

### Which Account Is Right for You?

**W-2 Employee:**
- Employer 401(k): Contribute at least enough to get the full match
- IRA: Traditional or Roth depending on income/tax situation
- HSA: If you have a high-deductible health plan

**Self-Employed (Solo):**
- SEP-IRA: Simple setup, high limits, but only employer contributions
- Solo 401(k): More complex, but employee + employer contributions

**Self-Employed (With Employees):**
- SIMPLE IRA: Lower limits but easier administration
- Traditional 401(k): Higher limits but more complex

---

### Traditional vs. Roth: Quick Decision Guide

**Choose Traditional (pre-tax) if:**
- You're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect in retirement
- You need to reduce current taxable income
- You want to lower your AGI for other benefits

**Choose Roth (after-tax) if:**
- You expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement
- You want tax-free growth and withdrawals
- You value the flexibility (no RMDs, contributions can be withdrawn)

**Not sure?** Consider splitting contributions between both.

---

### Contribution Deadlines

| Account Type | Deadline |
|--------------|----------|
| 401(k) employee contributions | December 31 of tax year |
| IRA (Traditional and Roth) | Tax filing deadline (April 15) |
| SEP-IRA | Tax filing deadline + extensions (Oct 15) |
| Solo 401(k) employee portion | December 31 of tax year |
| Solo 401(k) employer portion | Tax filing deadline + extensions |
| HSA | Tax filing deadline (April 15) |

---

### The Power of Tax-Deferred Growth

**$10,000 invested annually for 30 years at 7% return:**

- Taxable account (24% bracket): ~$550,000 after taxes
- Tax-deferred account: ~$945,000 (taxes due on withdrawal)
- Roth account: ~$945,000 (tax-free)

Tax-advantaged accounts can mean **$300,000+ more** in retirement.

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not contributing enough to get employer match** (it's free money!)
2. **Waiting until year-end** (you miss potential growth)
3. **Forgetting catch-up contributions** if you're 50+
4. **Overlooking HSA** (triple tax advantage)
5. **Not coordinating multiple accounts** (SEP + IRA, etc.)

## Guide 5: Year-End Tax Checklist

### 10 Things to Do Before December 31

---

### 1. Maximize Retirement Contributions

**Action:** Contribute as much as possible to 401(k), IRA, and other retirement accounts.

**Why:** Reduces your taxable income and builds retirement wealth.

**Deadline:** 401(k) contributions must be made by December 31. IRA contributions can be made until April 15.

---

### 2. Review Investment Gains and Losses

**Action:** Harvest tax losses to offset gains. Consider selling winners if you're in a low tax bracket.

**Why:** Capital gains are taxable. Losses can offset gains and up to $3,000 of ordinary income.

**Tip:** Watch the wash sale rule—don't buy back substantially identical securities within 30 days.

---

### 3. Make Charitable Donations

**Action:** Make planned donations before December 31.

**Why:** Charitable donations are deductible if you itemize.

**Tip:** Donate appreciated stock to avoid capital gains AND get a deduction for full market value.

---

### 4. Pay Deductible Expenses

**Action:** Prepay state taxes, property taxes, mortgage interest, or other deductible expenses.

**Why:** Accelerating deductions can reduce this year's taxes.

**Note:** SALT deduction is capped at $10,000.

---

### 5. Consider Bunching Deductions

**Action:** If you're close to the standard deduction threshold, bunch two years of deductions into one year.

**Why:** Itemize every other year, take standard deduction in between = more total deductions.

---

### 6. Use Your FSA Balance

**Action:** Spend remaining Flexible Spending Account funds.

**Why:** FSA funds generally expire at year-end (check your plan for grace periods).

**Tip:** Stock up on eligible medical supplies, eyeglasses, etc.

---

### 7. Contribute to 529 Plans

**Action:** Contribute to your state's 529 plan if it offers a state tax deduction.

**Why:** Many states offer deductions for 529 contributions.

**Note:** Federal deduction is not available, but growth is tax-free.

---

### 8. Defer Income (If Appropriate)

**Action:** If possible, delay receiving income until January.

**Why:** Pushes tax liability to next year.

**When this makes sense:** You expect to be in a lower bracket next year.

---

### 9. Review Withholding

**Action:** Check if you're on track to owe or get a large refund.

**Why:** Adjust W-4 now to avoid surprises at tax time.

---

### 10. Schedule a Tax Planning Meeting
