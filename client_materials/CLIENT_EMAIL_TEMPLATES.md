### Year-End Planning Reminder

**Subject:** Year-end tax moves to consider before December 31

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

With {{DAYS_LEFT}} days left in {{YEAR}}, now is the time to make tax-smart moves. Here are some things to consider:

**Before December 31:**

{{#if HAS_RETIREMENT_ROOM}}
**Retirement Contributions**
You can still contribute up to ${{RETIREMENT_LIMIT}} to your {{RETIREMENT_ACCOUNT_TYPE}}. Each dollar reduces your taxable income.
{{/if}}

{{#if HAS_CHARITABLE}}
**Charitable Giving**
If you're planning donations, make them by December 31 to deduct this year. Consider donating appreciated stock to avoid capital gains.
{{/if}}

{{#if HAS_BUSINESS}}
**Business Expenses**
Consider prepaying expenses or purchasing needed equipment before year-end. Section 179 allows immediate deduction of qualifying purchases.
{{/if}}

{{#if HAS_INVESTMENTS}}
**Tax-Loss Harvesting**
Review your portfolio for losses that could offset gains. Be mindful of wash sale rules.
{{/if}}

**Want a Year-End Review?**
I have a few slots open this month for year-end planning calls. [Schedule here]

{{CPA_NAME}}
