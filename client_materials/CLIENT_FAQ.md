---

### Do you offer a refund if I'm not satisfied?

If you're not satisfied with our work, please let us know immediately. We'll do everything we can to make it right. If we can't resolve the issue, we'll discuss a fair adjustment to your fee.

---

## Tax Preparation Process

---

### How long does it take to prepare my return?

Once we have all your documents:
- **Simple returns:** 3-5 business days
- **Moderate returns:** 5-7 business days
- **Complex returns:** 7-14 business days

During peak tax season (March-April), timelines may be longer. The earlier you submit your documents, the faster we can complete your return.

---

### What if I'm missing a document?

Upload what you have, and we'll track what's missing. You can view the "Missing Documents" list in your portal. We'll send reminders as deadlines approach.

If a document is significantly delayed (like a K-1), we can discuss filing an extension.

---

### How do I review my return before filing?

When your return is ready, you'll receive an email notification. Log in to your portal to:

1. View your complete return (PDF)
2. See a summary of key numbers (refund/owed, effective rate)
3. Approve for filing OR request changes

We won't file until you explicitly approve.

---

### What happens after I approve my return?

Within 1-2 business days:
1. We e-file your federal and state returns
2. You receive confirmation with tracking numbers
3. The IRS processes your return (typically 24-48 hours for acceptance)
4. You receive final confirmation of acceptance

If there are any issues, we'll contact you immediately.

---

### How long until I get my refund?

After your return is accepted:
- **Direct deposit:** 7-21 days (usually closer to 10-14)
- **Paper check:** 4-6 weeks

You can check your refund status at irs.gov/refunds using your SSN, filing status, and exact refund amount.

---

## Extensions & Deadlines

---

### What if I can't file by April 15?

No problem—we can file an extension. An extension gives you until October 15 to file your return.

**Important:** An extension to file is NOT an extension to pay. If you owe taxes, they're still due April 15, or you'll accrue penalties and interest.

---

### What if I owe taxes and can't pay?

You have options:
1. **File anyway** — The failure-to-file penalty is worse than failure-to-pay
2. **IRS payment plan** — You can set up monthly payments
3. **Pay what you can** — Partial payment reduces penalties and interest
4. **Short-term delay** — If you need 60-120 days, you can request extra time

Contact us to discuss your situation.

---

### What are the tax deadlines?

| Deadline | For |
|----------|-----|
| January 31 | Employers issue W-2s; 1099-NEC issued |
| April 15 | Individual tax returns due; Q1 estimated payment |
| June 15 | Q2 estimated payment |
| September 15 | Q3 estimated payment; extended partnership/S-Corp returns |
| October 15 | Extended individual returns due |
| January 15 | Q4 estimated payment |

## Tax Advisory Services

---

### What's the difference between tax preparation and tax advisory?

**Tax Preparation:**
- Looking backward at what happened last year
- Completing and filing your tax return
- Ensuring compliance with tax law

**Tax Advisory:**
- Looking forward to optimize your future taxes
- Analyzing "what if" scenarios
- Strategic planning (entity structure, retirement, investments)
- Proactive recommendations to reduce your tax burden

Most clients need both. Some only need preparation.

---

### What kind of advisory questions can you help with?

Common questions we help clients answer:
- Should I be an S-Corp?
- How much should I contribute to retirement?
- Should I convert to a Roth IRA?
- Is it better to buy or lease my business vehicle?
- How do I minimize taxes when selling my business/home/investments?
- What's the most tax-efficient way to pay myself?
- How do I plan for a major life event (marriage, kids, retirement)?

---

### How does your tax analysis work?

We use advanced tax intelligence software to:
1. Model your current tax situation
2. Run "what if" scenarios instantly
3. Compare different strategies side-by-side
4. Generate professional advisory reports

You'll see exactly how each decision affects your taxes—in real numbers, not estimates.

---

### Do I need advisory services?

Advisory services provide the most value if you:
- Are self-employed or own a business
- Have complex income (investments, rental properties, etc.)
- Are going through a major life change
- Feel like you might be paying more than necessary
- Want to proactively plan, not just react

If you have a simple W-2 situation with standard deductions, basic preparation may be all you need.

---

## IRS Notices & Audits

---

### What should I do if I get a letter from the IRS?

1. **Don't panic** — Most IRS letters are routine
2. **Don't ignore it** — Ignoring makes things worse
3. **Read carefully** — Note the issue and deadline
4. **Contact us** — Send us a copy; we'll review and advise

Many notices are simple issues (math errors, missing forms) that are easy to resolve.

---

### Do you help with IRS audits?

Yes. If you receive an audit notice for a return we prepared, we'll help you respond. Our services include:

- Reviewing the audit request
- Gathering required documentation
- Communicating with the IRS on your behalf
- Representing you at audit meetings (if needed)

Audit representation may require a separate engagement depending on complexity.

---

### What triggers an IRS audit?

Common audit triggers include:
- High income (especially $200K+)
- Large deductions relative to income
- Cash-heavy businesses
- Home office deductions
- Large charitable contributions
- Cryptocurrency transactions
- Unreported income (IRS has matching data)
- Math errors or inconsistencies

Having a CPA prepare your return doesn't prevent audits, but it ensures your return is accurate and defensible.

---

### Can I contact you outside of tax season?

Absolutely. We're here year-round for:
- Tax planning questions
- Life change consultations

If you're working with another CPA and want to switch to us, we'll make the transition smooth:
1. We'll request your prior year returns from your previous preparer
